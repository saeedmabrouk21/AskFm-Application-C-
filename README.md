# AskFm-Application-Cpp
## Tried to get some features of AskFm website log in, ask question, answer question, and delete question .etc.  
## Applied OOP Concepts  
Mainly the code is divided into three classes : SYSTEM, USER and MASSAGE.  
  SYSTEM : have all information such as mapping user ID to USER object and mapping message ID to MASSAGE opject.  
           it also contain all screens which used in project  
           features are presented as methods in system such as "ask question" and "delte question".etc.  
  USER : contain basic information of the user as username, password, mail and gender  
         has also three containers of numbers first  : the IDs of asked questions  
                                              second : the IDs of unanswered questions  
                                              third  : the IDs of answered questions  
  MASSAGE : question, answer and threads are acting as a message so a message can any one of them  
            it contain info such as the ID of sender and receiver and label and message content
